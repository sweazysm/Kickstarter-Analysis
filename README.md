# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
---
I performed an analysis of Kickstarter campaigns in order to uncover trends. Our client, Louise, wanted to start a project and requested data on other Kickstarters to better inform her on what decisions to make. Through data analysis I uncovered trends and visualized data in order to give her a comprehensive overview of the data relevant to her future interests.

From the data gathered, Louise should start a Kickstarter Campaign around May or June with a fundraising goal of between $2,000 - $4,000
